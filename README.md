# JokeServer


Multi-Threaded Server and Client


Joke clients connect to the joke server and ask for a joke or proverb. The server then sends back the joke or proverb, and only the client retains the state. The state is exchanged between the client and the server. The JokeClientAdmin has the ability to modify the mode in which a joke or proverb is sent to the client. By pressing enter, the administrator toggles this. Client, admin, and server all have access to secondary server capability.
